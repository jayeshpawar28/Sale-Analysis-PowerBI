![Dashboard Picure](Dashboard-Picture.png)

This project allowed me to dive deep into data modeling (using star schema), DAX measures (including time intelligence for MoM analysis), and advanced visualization techniques like dynamic trend charts with field parameters and interactive tooltips. 

# Key Skills Learned
